# Choice Texts
This is a web app, designed with PyWebIO, which aims to make text files permanent on the Algorand Blockchain.

## Usage
1. Download this entire folder.
2. Install required packages using ```pip install -r requirements.txt```.
3. Edit Environment Variables -> add variable name "test_mnemonic" <br />with variable value which is your test mnemonic.
5. Run deploy.py through ```python deploy.py```.

Running deploy.py will start a new tab in the user's default 
web browser. All functionalities therein are intact and the user 
can now start making text files permanent on the Algorand blockchain.

## Notes
Only use text files that are allowed to be accessed publicly. Never use this web app with <br/> 
text files containing private information as they will be made permanent in the Algorand blockchain <br/>
which is a ```public``` blockchain.
